        <p>Ma'an is one of Jordan’s oldest continuously inhabited cities, with roots stretching back to the Nabataeans. 
        Located along the historic King’s Highway and today a key stop on the Desert Highway, Ma’an has long served as a 
        strategic crossroads for trade, travel, and pilgrimage. Known for its deep tribal heritage and cultural endurance, 
        the city has played an important role in major regional events throughout Arab and Jordanian history.
